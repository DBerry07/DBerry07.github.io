My name is David WJ Berry and software is my passion; in particular, I love programming!
More specifically, I am a software developer currently located in South Florida with nearly two years of professional native Android app development experience.
My passion for software development stems from my enjoyment of puzzle-solving and building things.
I also enjoy learning, and I am always eager to learn new things; to this end, I have completed (and in the process of completing) a number of courses on Coursera and Udemy.
