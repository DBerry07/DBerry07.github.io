Why is this on GitFront?
When this project was public on GitHub, a number of people downloaded it and submitted it as their own work for the Vanderbilt Android Specialization Capstone course.
Not wanting others to claim my work as theirs so as to get course credit, I decided to make the repository private on GitHub and host the repo on GitFront.
