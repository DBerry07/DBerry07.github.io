CaliberDroid is a native Android mobile app designed for keeping track of the progress of classes of students (refered to as "batches of associates") enrolled in Revature's training program. There are two separate log-ins, QC ("Quality Control") Managers and Trainers. Each batch has a trainer assigned to it that teaches the students. QC managers rate (or "audit") the progress of each associate in a given batch.
There are multiple locations corresponding to the different locations of Revature's various training programs. A trainer only has access to information and locations that they are directly responsible for; these permissions are controlled by the QC managers.
When grading an associate, a QC manager can assign one of several ratings (good, poor, excellent, etc.) as well as put notes relevant to that particular associate. Trainers can also write notes related to the progress of each associate.
As a project involving six people, I was responsible for developing only a part of the program (my responsiblities are listed below). Each day we would have a "stand-up" to discuss our progress on the development of the app as well as any problems or challenges we have encountered. Likewise, we held regular meetings on the design of the app - both as it was programmitcally designed and aestectically designed.
Unfortunately, the app needs access to a database that is no longer maintained in order to work. As such, only the code is viewable - I have no videos or images of the app running.
