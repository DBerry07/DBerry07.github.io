SimpleTodoList is a native Android application coded in Kotlin with Firebase Firestore integration.
It allows the user to create a task, edit a task, delete a task, and mark a task as completed. These tasks appear in a list on the main page. The app also features a "priority" labeling, allowing the user to label a task in one of four priorities - Normal, Low, Medium, and High.
Depending on whether the user has marked a task as "completed", the task appears in either the "Uncompleted" list or "Completed" list.
The app also has sort and filter functions: the user can sort the list based on task ID numbers and sort on the tasks' priority; likewise, the user can use a filter to show only tasks that match the a specific priority.
Currently, the app only supports one login that is shared between all users.
