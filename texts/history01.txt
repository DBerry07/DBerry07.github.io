With the COVID pandemic ending, I was contacted by Revature to interview with a potential client. I agreed and signed a new contract with Revature. Following that, interviewed by Bank of America's mobile team manager for a position on Bank of America's Research Library Android team. Passing the interview, was signed to work for BofA through Accenture (via Revature).
Worked for a year on BofA's mobile team for their Research Library Android app. Primarily worked on fixing small bugs and finding and correcting security vulnerabilities using Checkmarx for the aforementioned Android app; also utlized Jenkins in performing this work.
Also did some work on the Research Library iOS app when the dedicated iOS developers were unavailable. This work was also fixing small bugs and errors. In order to do this bit of work, I had to quickly learn the basics of iOS development in Objective-C. By fixing these bugs in the iOS app, I reduced app down-time from two weeks (length of time that iOS developers were unavailable) to several days.
My contract with BofA was eventually terminated due to downsizing of the mobile development teams.
