Revature, LLC. (Jan 2020 - Sept 2020, Contract)
I attended an eleven week Revature skill development camp, where I focused on native Android development. Afterwords, I did interviews for a number of potential clients before signing a contract with Accenture. 
However, with the onset of the COVID pandemic, the contract was nullified before I could begin working for the client. After that, I was put on standby (but kept on Revature's payroll) before my contract was mutually terminated.
