My project that I submittted to Coursera's Vanderbilt-developed Android developer specialization capstone course.
This is a note-taking and -saving app. The user is able to write their own notes and save those notes to their local phone storage. The notes are displayed using a RecyclerView in order of date created. Users can also edit a previously created note or delete a note.",
Contains all four of the major Android app components - Activities, Broadcast Receivers, Services, and Content Providers.
This version of the app is written in Kotlin.",
The notes themselves are saved to an SQLite Database using a Content Provider - MyContentProvider.
ImageDownloadService is used to download an image for display on LaunchActivity. This is the remote Web Service as required by the project specifications.
Two Broadcast Receivers are used in this app: one is used to receive the image bitmap data from the Download Async Task that handles the image download process; the other displays notifications to the user when Content Provider tasks are executed.
Activities are used to allow the user to interact with the app. There are 4 Activities with one acting as a superclass for the other four.
