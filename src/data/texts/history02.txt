Revature, LLC. (Jan 2020 - Sept 2020, Contract)
Attended a Revature skill development camp - where I focused on native Android development - which took eleven weeks. Afterwords, did interviews for potential clients before signing a contract with Accenture. However, with the onset of the COVID pandemic, the contract was nullified before I could begin working for the client. After that, I was put on standby on Revature's payroll before my contract was mutually terminated.
