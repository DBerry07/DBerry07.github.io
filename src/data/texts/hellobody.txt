My name is David WJ Berry. Welcome to my webpage!
I am a software developer currently located in South Florida with nearly two years of professional native Android app development experience.
During my professional career, I have worked for Bank of America and for Accenture.
I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Florida Atlantic University in 2019.
I have been described as detail-oriented and analytical.
My passion for software development stems from my enjoyment of puzzle-solving and of building functional things.
I am always eager to learn new things and have completed (and in the process of completing) a number of courses on Coursera and Udemy.
